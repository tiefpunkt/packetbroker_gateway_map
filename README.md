# Packetbroker Gateway Map

The packetbroker API allows to query a certain area for its LoRaWAN gateways and their status. This  webpage does so and displays them neatly on a map.

To get started, you need to get a MapBox Token, and insert it into the map.html file. Location is currently set to Munich, and the radius to 10km.
